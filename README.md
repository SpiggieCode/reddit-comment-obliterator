# Reddit Comment Obliterator

I got tired of searching for reddit scripts that would clear my comment history, only to install them and find out that they no longer works.
So, as one does, I made my own Tampermonkey script. This is working as of 8/8/2023.

INSTRUCTIONS:

Install tampermonkey extension for your browser (google it)
Create a new script
Delete boilerplate code
Copy the script here and paste it into the newly created script
Save, check that the script is enabled

Login to old.reddit.com
Click the comments tab
The link should look like https://old.reddit.com/user/*YOUR USERNAME HERE*/comments
The script will automatically begin deleting comments.
Since this runs on a loop, you will need to watch until all comments are deleted and manually stop the script
I recommend enabling the script only when you want to clear comment history
