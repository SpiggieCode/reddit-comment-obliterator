# Reddit Comment Obliterator

I got tired of searching for reddit scripts that would clear my comment history, only to install them and find out that they no longer works. <br>
So, as one does, I made my own Tampermonkey script. This is working as of 8/8/2023. <br>

INSTRUCTIONS:

Install tampermonkey extension for your browser (google it) <br>
Create a new script <br>
Delete boilerplate code <br>
Copy the script here and paste it into the newly created script <br>
Save, check that the script is enabled <br>

Login to old.reddit.com <br>
Click the comments tab <br>
The link should look like https://old.reddit.com/user/*YOUR USERNAME HERE*/comments <br>
The script will automatically begin deleting comments. <br>
Since this runs on a loop, you will need to watch until all comments are deleted and manually stop the script <br>
I recommend enabling the script only when you want to clear comment history <br>
